# Data Distribution Analysis

## Overview
This Python program analyzes the distribution of 10,000 random numbers and generates a histogram and a pie chart heatmap to visualize the data distribution.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries:
  - matplotlib
  - numpy

## Installation
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
3. Install the required Python libraries using pip:
    ```
    pip install matplotlib numpy
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the program by executing `data_distribution.py`.
    ```
    python data_distribution.py
    ```
2. The program will generate a histogram and a pie chart heatmap to visualize the distribution of the random numbers.
3. The generated plots will be saved in the same directory as `histogram.png` and `heatmap_piechart.png`.

## File Structure
- `data_distribution.py`: Main Python script for data distribution analysis.
- `histogram.png`: Generated histogram plot.
- `heatmap_piechart.png`: Generated pie chart heatmap plot.
- `README.md`: Documentation file.
